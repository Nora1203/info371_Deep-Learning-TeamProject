# Public Attitudes Toward ChatGPT During Early-Release Stage on Twitter: Different Perceptions in Health Versus Teaching Professionals

Our project investigates public perceptions of ChatGPT on Twitter during its initial release. Analyzing 39,054 English
tweets posted within a month of ChatGPT release from Kaggle, we utilized sentiment analysis, topic modeling, and
zero-shot classification to understand general and occupation-based attitudes toward ChatGPT. Our results indicate
predominant positive and neutral sentiments in early-stage ChatGPT discussions, consistent across varied topics.
Amongst "professionals," health and business sectors showed more positivity, whereas the cultural and teaching
sectors exhibited skepticism, suggesting the influence of professional backgrounds on ChatGPT perceptions.
